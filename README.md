# Heuristics_for_Transportation_Problem
This repository contains 44 heuristic methods to solve a traditional transportation problem (TP). 
However, these codes are aimed at solving a special case of TP i.e., the allocation of city buses to depots (ACBD) problem.
The objective of the ACBD problem is to allocate a given number of buses to available number of depots by minimizing the economic and the environmental cost.
